# Tabletop Role-Playing Game Inventory Manager

This program is intended to help manage and keep track of items and/or resources among player characters in a TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game)

## To-Do List

1. Write integration tests to test the interactions between the JdbcDao classes and the SQL database
2. Populate the main database and the test database
3. Add the ability to select, add, update, and delete characters (much like how items are currently set up)
4. Create more detailed columns for the character table which could include specific skill and ability characteristics
5. Introduce functionality to roll dice, adding both the character's skill and any item effects that could grant bonuses

## Completed tasks
1. Integration tests for JdbcItemDao complete
2. Integration tests for JdbcCharacterDao complete

## Known bugs
